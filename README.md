At this point the code only compiles on Linux due to missing implementations of endianness for other platforms (see btypes.h)
There is currently also a hard-coded dependency on the Botan C++ crypto library version 1.11 (see CMakeLists.txt)
Botan must be installed with prefix /usr/local, which is the default when compiling from source
